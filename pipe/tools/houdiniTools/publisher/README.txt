This tool is being developed from the DCC tools. Martin Edwards is spearheading it LIKE A BOSS!!!
June 9: Started reading code


Here's a quick overview of what the publisher tools do:


Asset:
    Still unclear on this one...
    My guess:
    Takes assembled asset and versions up the current hda it's connected to.

Tool:
    TLDR: saves versioned tool .hda with notes

    Opens a dialog box and requests first tool Name, then a comment to publish the tool with (note: only lets you publish over pre-made tools)
    versions up the HDA
    adds note in HDA metadata
    Saves versioned (hda tools stored where?)

Shot:
    TLDR: saves versioned shot .hip with notes

    Opens a dialog box and requests first Shot Name, then a comment to publish the shot with (note: only lets you publish over pre-made shots)
    Changes hip file name to reflect current shot and version number
    Saves hip file into the /groups/cenote/BYU_anm_pipeline/production/shots/[current shot] folder
    Connects shot note and version number in the [forgot what it's called] file
